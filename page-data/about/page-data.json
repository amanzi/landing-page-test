It includes general polyhedral mesh infrastructure, which leverages MSTK, advanced discretizations of process models, including traditional finite volume schemes, mimetic finite differences, and nonlinear finite volumes.  In addition, it provides advanced nonlinear solvers, such as Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration (NKA) and Anderson Acceleration, and leverages Trilinos-ML and Hypre Algebraic Multigrid for scalable solvers. The reaction of contaminants and minerals carried by the flow through the surrounding rock and soil is modeled through a general software interface called Alquimia that allows Amanzi to interface with a variety of powerful geochemistry engines including PFLOTRAN and CrunchFlow. The code is parallel and leverages open-source parallel frameworks such as Trilinos, PETSc.

This capability in conjuction with its powerful mesh infrastructure enables the splitting and subsetting of meshes to unleash creative conceptual modelin.

This can (but need not) include thermal processes (especially ice for frozen soils), evapo-transpiration, albedo-driven surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant dynamics, deformation, transport, and much more.
